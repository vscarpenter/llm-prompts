## Prompt
> Create a 2x2 matrix analysis to visualize trade-offs and strategic positioning.
>
> Topic: "{{topic}}"
>
> **Deliverables:**
> 1. X-axis label: {{dimension_1}} (low to high)
> 2. Y-axis label: {{dimension_2}} (low to high)
> 3. Four quadrant labels with strategic implications
> 4. Plot 4-6 items on the matrix with brief explanations
> 5. Key insights from the positioning

## Tips / Notes
- Common axes: Effort vs Impact, Cost vs Value, Risk vs Reward, Urgency vs Importance
- Specify items to plot: "plot our top 5 product features" or "compare these 6 marketing channels"
- Add context for better positioning: include relevant data or criteria
- For visual output: request "create Markdown table format" or "ASCII diagram"

## Variants
- "BCG Matrix" (Market Share vs Market Growth for portfolio analysis)
- "Eisenhower Matrix" (Urgent vs Important for task prioritization)
- "Custom axes: {{custom_x}} vs {{custom_y}}" (define your own dimensions)
- "Include action items for each quadrant" (what to do with items in each area)
