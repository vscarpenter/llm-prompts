> ## Weighted Summary
>
> **Score Calculation:**
> - Strong pros: 3 points each = [X points]
> - Moderate pros: 2 points each = [Y points]
> - Minor pros: 1 point each = [Z points]
> - **Total Pros**: [X+Y+Z]
>
> - Strong cons: -3 points each = [-A points]
> - Moderate cons: -2 points each = [-B points]
> - Minor cons: -1 point each = [-C points]
> - **Total Cons**: [-A-B-C]
>
> **Net Score**: [Total Pros + Total Cons]
>
> ## Key Considerations
>
> **Deal-breakers** (cons that could override all pros):
> - [Fatal flaw if it exists]
>
> **Must-haves** (pros that are essential):
> - [Critical benefit if it exists]
>
> **Trade-offs**:
> - We gain [X] but sacrifice [Y]
> - We solve [A] but create [B]
>
> ## Mitigations
>
> **How to reduce cons:**
> - Con 1 mitigation: [Strategy to minimize this drawback]
> - Con 2 mitigation: [Strategy to minimize this drawback]
>
> ## Alternative Framing
>
> **What if we don't do this?**
> - Opportunity cost: [What we miss out on]
> - Status quo consequences: [What happens if we stay the same]
>
> ## Recommendation
>
> **Lean**: ✅ Yes / ❌ No / ⚠️ Conditional
>
> **Rationale**: [Why this is the right call based on the analysis]
>
> **Conditions** (if applicable):
> - Proceed if: [Condition]
> - Only if we can: [Mitigation]
>
> **Confidence level**: [High/Medium/Low]
>
> **What would change the recommendation**:
> - [Factor that would flip the decision]

## Tips / Notes
- Specify balance: "devil's advocate mode" (emphasize cons) or "optimistic mode" (emphasize pros)
- Add perspective: "from customer viewpoint," "from business viewpoint," "from team viewpoint"
- Request structure: "prioritized by impact" or "grouped by category (financial, strategic, operational)"
- For decisions: "include decision criteria and which pros/cons matter most"

## Variants
- "Pre-mortem analysis" (imagine it failed, what would the cons have been)
- "Opportunity cost analysis" (what we give up by choosing this)
- "Stakeholder perspective" (pros/cons from different viewpoints)
- "Timeline-based pros/cons" (short-term vs long-term trade-offs)
