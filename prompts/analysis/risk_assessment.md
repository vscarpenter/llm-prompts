# Risk Assessment

## Prompt
> Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for this project, decision, or initiative.
>
> Subject: "{{project_or_decision}}"
> Context: "{{background}}"
> Timeline: "{{when_this_will_happen}}"
> Stakeholders: "{{who_is_affected}}"
> Goals: "{{what_success_looks_like}}"
>
> **Risk Assessment:**
>
> **1. Risk Identification**
>
> Identify all potential risks across categories:
>
> **Technical Risks:**
> - Risk 1: [Description]
> - Risk 2: [Description]
>
> **Business Risks:**
> - Risk 1: [Description]
> - Risk 2: [Description]
>
> **Operational Risks:**
> - Risk 1: [Description]
> - Risk 2: [Description]
>
> **External Risks:**
> - Risk 1: [Description]
> - Risk 2: [Description]
>
> **People/Team Risks:**
> - Risk 1: [Description]
> - Risk 2: [Description]
>
> **2. Risk Analysis Matrix**
>
> | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Category |
> |---------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|----------|
> | R1 | [Description] | 4 | 5 | 20 (High) | Technical |
> | R2 | [Description] | 2 | 4 | 8 (Medium) | Business |
> | R3 | [Description] | 3 | 2 | 6 (Low) | Operational |
>
> **Risk Score Calculation**: Probability × Impact
> - 15-25: Critical (red)
> - 8-14: High (orange)
> - 4-7: Medium (yellow)
> - 1-3: Low (green)
>
> **3. Top Risks (Prioritized)**
>
> **Risk #1: [Critical Risk]**
> - **Probability**: [X/5] - [Likelihood description]
> - **Impact**: [Y/5] - [What happens if it occurs]
> - **Risk Score**: [X×Y]
> - **Triggers**: [Warning signs this is happening]
> - **Affected areas**: [What/who is impacted]
>
> **Risk #2: [High Risk]**
> - [Same structure]
>
> **4. Mitigation Strategies**
>
> For each top risk:
>
> **Risk: [Name]**
>
> **Mitigation approach**: Avoid | Reduce | Transfer | Accept
>
> **Actions to reduce probability:**
> - Action 1 (Owner, Timeline)
> - Action 2 (Owner, Timeline)
>
> **Actions to reduce impact:**
> - Action 1 (Owner, Timeline)
> - Action 2 (Owner, Timeline)
>
> **Contingency plan** (if risk occurs):
> - Step 1
> - Step 2
> - Step 3
>
> **Risk owner**: [Person responsible for monitoring]
>
> **5. Risk Monitoring Plan**
> - How often to review risks: [Frequency]
> - Leading indicators to track: [Metrics]
> - Escalation process: [When/how to escalate]
> - Review dates: [Schedule]
>
> **6. Residual Risk**
> - After mitigation, what risks remain?
> - Are residual risks acceptable?
> - Sign-off needed from: [Stakeholders]

## Tips / Notes
- Specify scope: "project risk," "strategic risk," "operational risk," "cybersecurity risk"
- Add framework: "use ISO 31000," "NIST framework," "custom risk matrix"
- Request depth: "high-level overview" or "detailed risk register"
- For compliance: "include regulatory risks and compliance requirements"

## Variants
- "Project risk register" (ongoing tracking document)
- "Security risk assessment" (threat modeling, vulnerabilities)
- "Financial risk analysis" (market, credit, liquidity risks)
- "Strategic risk assessment" (business model, competitive, reputation risks)
