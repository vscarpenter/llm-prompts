# SWOT Analysis Generator

## Prompt
```
Create a SWOT analysis for [TOPIC/DECISION/PROJECT].

Context: [PROVIDE BACKGROUND]

Format as:
Strengths: (internal, positive)
Weaknesses: (internal, negative)
Opportunities: (external, positive)
Threats: (external, negative)

Be specific and actionable rather than generic.
```

## Tips / Notes
- Provide context for better analysis: include industry, market conditions, timeline
- Specify perspective: "from a startup viewpoint" or "for enterprise adoption"
- Request prioritization: "rank items by impact" or "highlight top 3 in each category"
- Add constraints: "focus on next 12 months" or "consider only technical factors"

## Variants
- "SWOT with action items" (include specific next steps for each quadrant)
- "Competitive SWOT" (compare against specific competitors)
- "TOWS Matrix" (match external opportunities/threats with internal strengths/weaknesses)
- "Weighted SWOT" (assign importance scores to each item)
