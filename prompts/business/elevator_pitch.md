## Tips / Notes
- Specify audience: "for investors," "for customers," "for potential hires," "for press"
- Add personality: "inject humor," "lead with mission," "use storytelling"
- Request hooks: "create 5 different opening hooks to test"
- For practice: "include common objections and responses"

## Variants
- "Investor pitch" (focus on market size, traction, team)
- "Customer pitch" (focus on pain and solution)
- "Recruiting pitch" (focus on mission and opportunity)
- "Competition pitch format" (problem, existing solutions, why they fail, our better way)
