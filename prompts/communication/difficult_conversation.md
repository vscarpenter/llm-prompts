> **Difficult Conversation Framework:**
>
> **1. Conversation Preparation**
>
> **Your Intention:**
> - What's the positive outcome you're aiming for?
> - What do you want for yourself, the other person, and the relationship?
>
> **Your Contribution:**
> - What role have you played in creating or perpetuating this situation?
> - What assumptions are you making?
> - What might you be missing or not seeing?
>
> **Their Perspective:**
> - What might their story be about this situation?
> - What pressures or constraints might they be under?
> - What are they likely feeling?
>
> **2. Conversation Structure**
>
> **Opening (Set the tone)**
>
> Frame the conversation positively:
> > "I wanted to talk with you about [topic] because [positive intention]. I care about [relationship/outcome] and want to make sure we're aligned."
>
> Get permission:
> > "Is now a good time? This might take about [X] minutes."
>
> **Your Perspective (Use "I" statements)**
>
> Share your observations without judgment:
> > "Here's what I've observed: [Specific behaviors or facts, not interpretations]"
>
> Share your interpretation and feelings:
> > "My take on this is [interpretation], and I feel [emotion] about it because [impact]."
>
> Acknowledge your contribution:
> > "I realize I may have contributed by [your part in this]."
>
> **Invite Their Perspective**
>
> > "I'd really like to hear your perspective on this. How do you see the situation?"
>
> Listen actively:
> - Paraphrase to confirm understanding
> - Ask clarifying questions
> - Validate their feelings (even if you disagree with their view)
>
> **Explore Together**
>
> > "It sounds like [summarize their view]. From my side, [restate your view]. Where do our perspectives overlap? What am I missing?"
>
> Look for common ground:
> - Shared goals
> - Mutual interests
> - Agreement on the problem (even if not the solution)
>
> **Move to Problem-Solving**
>
> > "Given what we've both shared, what would help us move forward? What would make this better for both of us?"
>
> Propose solutions collaboratively:
> - "What if we..."
> - "How about..."
> - "Would it help if..."
>
> **Close with Commitment**
>
> Summarize agreements:
> > "So we're agreeing to [specific actions]. I'll [your commitment] and you'll [their commitment]. Let's check in [when] to see how it's going."
>
> End positively:
> > "I appreciate you having this conversation with me. I value [relationship/work together]."
>
> **3. Potential Responses & Deflections**
>
> **If they get defensive:**
> - Acknowledge their emotion: "I can see this is frustrating for you."
> - Restate your positive intention: "I want to figure this out together."
> - Return to facts: "Let's look at what actually happened..."
>
> **If they blame you:**
> - Take responsibility where appropriate: "You're right, I did [X]."
> - Redirect to the issue: "And what I'm hoping we can figure out is how to [move forward]."
>
> **If they shut down:**
> - Give them space: "I can see this is a lot. Do you need some time to think about it?"
> - Offer to continue later: "Let's take a break and revisit this [when]."
>
> **If they agree too quickly:**
> - Test for genuine buy-in: "What concerns do you have about this?"
> - Explore implications: "What would this mean for [situation]?"
>
> **4. Self-Care Reminders**
>
> **Before the conversation:**
> - [ ] Ground yourself (breathe, center your intention)
> - [ ] Check your emotional state (am I too activated to do this well?)
> - [ ] Remind yourself: progress over perfection
>
> **During the conversation:**
> - [ ] Breathe
> - [ ] Listen to understand, not to respond
> - [ ] Pause before reacting
> - [ ] It's okay to say "I need a moment to think about that"
>
> **After the conversation:**
> - [ ] Debrief with yourself: what went well? what would you do differently?
> - [ ] Follow up with agreed-upon actions
> - [ ] Practice self-compassion (you're learning)

## Tips / Notes
- Specify situation: "performance issue," "conflict resolution," "giving tough feedback," "setting boundaries"
- Add relationship context: "with manager (power dynamics)," "with peer (collaborative)," "with direct report (coaching)"
- Request tone: "direct but kind," "empathetic and curious," "assertive and clear"
- For practice: "include role-play scenarios and responses"

## Variants
- "Crucial Conversations framework" (based on Patterson et al. model)
- "Nonviolent Communication (NVC)" (observations, feelings, needs, requests)
- "Radical Candor approach" (care personally, challenge directly)
- "Performance improvement conversation" (specific to underperformance)
