> Impact: "{{impact}}"
>
> **Feedback structure (SBI Framework):**
> 1. **Situation:** When/where this occurred (specific, recent)
> 2. **Behavior:** Observable actions (not judgments or assumptions)

## Tips / Notes
- For positive feedback, be specific about what to keep doing
- For critical feedback, focus on behavior not personality
- End with a question: "How do you see it?" or "What support do you need?"
- Specify relationship: "for peer," "for direct report," "for manager"

## Variants
- "360 feedback format" (structured with rating + comments)
- "Radical candor approach" (direct but caring)
- "Growth-focused feedback" (emphasize potential and development)
- "Peer feedback" (collaborative, equals-based tone)
