## Tips / Notes
- Specify meeting type: "brainstorming," "decision-making," "status update," "working session"
- Add structure: "include icebreaker," "include retrospective format," "include decision-making framework"
- Request timing: "strict time-boxing" or "flexible based on discussion"
- For recurring: "include template for weekly check-in"

## Variants
- "Strategic planning session" (vision, goals, roadmap focus)
- "1-on-1 agenda" (manager-report check-in structure)
- "All-hands agenda" (company-wide update format)
- "Workshop agenda" (interactive, activity-based structure)
