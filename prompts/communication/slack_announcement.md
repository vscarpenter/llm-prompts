> ## Best Practices for Slack Announcements
>
> **Do:**
> - ✅ Use @channel sparingly (only for urgent/important company-wide news)
> - ✅ Front-load the key information
> - ✅ Use bullet points for scannability
> - ✅ Include clear next steps or actions
> - ✅ Add relevant emojis (but don't overdo it)
> - ✅ Link to detailed docs rather than pasting walls of text
> - ✅ Set expectations for responses
>
> **Don't:**
> - ❌ Use @here/@channel for non-urgent updates
> - ❌ Write paragraphs without breaks
> - ❌ Assume everyone will read carefully (make it skimmable)
> - ❌ Forget to specify deadlines or action items
> - ❌ Use jargon or acronyms without explanation
>
> **Timing tips:**
> - Avoid Monday mornings (inbox overload)
> - Avoid Friday afternoons (weekend mode)
> - Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-3pm
> - For global teams: consider time zones
>
> **Follow-up:**
> - Pin important messages to channel
> - Cross-post to relevant channels if needed
> - Summarize key thread responses
> - Follow up with reminder if action required

## Tips / Notes
- Specify urgency: "urgent," "FYI," "action required by [date]"
- Add tone: "celebratory," "serious," "casual," "formal"
- Request format: "short and punchy" or "detailed with context"
- For reach: "optimize for skimmers" or "include visual (screenshot/gif)"

## Variants
- "Company all-hands summary" (post-meeting recap)
- "Product launch announcement" (internal team excitement)
- "Incident communication" (transparent, factual, action-oriented)
- "Weekly team update" (recurring format with consistent structure)
