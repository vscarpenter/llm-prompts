## Tips / Notes
- Specify frequency: "weekly team update," "monthly exec report," "quarterly board update"
- Add tone: "celebratory" (good progress), "rallying" (need focus), "transparent" (challenges)
- Request format: "bullet format only," "narrative style," "dashboard style"
- For teams: "include team shout-outs" or "include learning/insights section"

## Variants
- "Executive dashboard" (visual, metrics-heavy, one-page)
- "Team all-hands update" (broader context, team wins, culture notes)
- "Board update" (strategic focus, financial metrics, big picture)
- "Project status report" (detailed timeline, Gantt chart, dependencies)
