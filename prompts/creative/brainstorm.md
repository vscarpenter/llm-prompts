## Tips / Notes
- Specify brainstorming method: "SCAMPER," "Six Thinking Hats," "Random word association"
- Add constraints for creativity: "must use existing resources" or "must launch in 30 days"
- Request specific types: "focus on low-cost ideas" or "blue-sky thinking, no limits"
- For teams: "include ideas for different skill levels" or "ideas that could fail interestingly"

## Variants
- "Reverse brainstorming" (how to cause the problem, then invert)
- "SCAMPER method" (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse)
- "Rapid ideation" (quantity over quality, 50 ideas in 10 minutes)
- "Constraint-based creativity" (use limitations as creative fuel)
