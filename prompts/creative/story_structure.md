## Tips / Notes
- Specify structure: "Hero's Journey," "Save the Cat," "Freytag's Pyramid," "Snowflake method"
- Add genre conventions: "include romance subplot," "twist ending required"
- Character focus: "ensemble cast" vs "single protagonist journey"
- For nonfiction narrative: "true story structure" or "case study format"

## Variants
- "Character development arc" (focus on internal transformation)
- "Scene-by-scene outline" (detailed beat sheet)
- "Parallel storylines" (multiple POVs or timelines)
- "Short story structure" (compressed three-act for 5-10 pages)
