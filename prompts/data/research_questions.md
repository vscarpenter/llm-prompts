# Research Questions Generator

## Prompt
> Generate well-structured research questions for this topic or area of inquiry.
>
> Topic: "{{research_topic}}"
> Research context: "{{field_or_domain}}"
> Goal: "{{exploratory|explanatory|descriptive|evaluative}}"
> Scope: "{{academic|business|user_research}}"
>
> **Research questions output:**
>
> **Primary Research Question:**
> [Overarching question that guides the entire study]
>
> **Secondary Research Questions** (3-5 supporting questions):
> 1. [Question that explores one aspect]
> 2. [Question that explores another dimension]
> 3. [Question about relationships or causes]
>
> **For each question, specify:**
> - Type: Descriptive / Explanatory / Evaluative
> - Method: How to answer it (survey, experiment, analysis, etc.)
> - Why it matters: Significance of answering this question
> - Measurability: How you'll know when you've answered it
>
> **Hypothesis (if appropriate):**
> - Expected answer or relationship to test
>
> **Question quality checklist:**
> - ✓ Specific and focused
> - ✓ Answerable with available methods/data
> - ✓ Original or adds new insight
> - ✓ Relevant to stakeholders
> - ✓ Ethical to investigate

## Tips / Notes
- Specify research type: "quantitative study," "qualitative research," "mixed methods"
- Add constraints: "must be answerable in 3 months," "with budget of $10k"
- Request refinement: "take broad topic and narrow to specific questions"
- For academic: "include literature gap this addresses"

## Variants
- "Question refinement" (improve vague questions to be more specific)
- "Hypothesis generation" (from research questions to testable hypotheses)
- "User research interview questions" (from research goals to interview guide)
- "Survey question design" (from research questions to survey items)
