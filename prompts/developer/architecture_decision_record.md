## Tips / Notes
- Specify scope: "architectural," "framework choice," "data modeling," "infrastructure"
- Add rigor: "include performance benchmarks" or "cost analysis"
- Request format: "follow MADR template" or "Y-statement format"
- For review: "include decision review date and criteria"

## Variants
- "Lightweight ADR" (simplified one-pager format)
- "Y-statement ADR" (In the context of X, facing Y, we decided Z to achieve A, accepting B)
- "Technology radar entry" (assess, trial, adopt, hold)
- "RFC (Request for Comments)" (more collaborative, pre-decision format)
