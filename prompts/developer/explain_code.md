# Explain Code in Plain English

## Prompt
> Analyze the following code and explain it for a non-technical audience.
>
> **Code to explain:**
> ```
> {{code_snippet}}
> ```
>
> **Provide your explanation in the following structure:**
>
> **1. One-Line Summary**
> What does this code do in a single sentence?
>
> **2. Real-World Analogy**
> Compare this code to an everyday process or situation that anyone would understand.
>
> **3. Step-by-Step Breakdown**
> Walk through what happens in simple terms:
> - What goes in (inputs)
> - What happens to it (processing)
> - What comes out (outputs)
>
> **4. Why It Matters**
> Explain the practical purpose - what problem does this solve or what does it enable?
>
> **5. Key Technical Terms (if any)**
> Define only essential technical terms in plain language. Format as:
> - **Term**: Simple definition
>
> **Guidelines:**
> - Assume zero programming knowledge
> - Use everyday language and avoid jargon
> - If you must use a technical term, immediately explain it
> - Focus on WHAT the code does, not HOW it does it
> - Use concrete examples when possible
> - Keep explanations concise but complete
> - Relate to familiar concepts (like cooking recipes, filing systems, assembly lines, etc.)
>
> **Tone:**
> - Friendly and approachable
> - Patient and encouraging
> - Like explaining to a curious friend over coffee
>
> **Avoid:**
> - Programming terminology without explanation
> - Overwhelming detail about implementation
> - Assuming any prior technical knowledge
> - Phrases like "simply," "obviously," or "just" (these can be condescending)

## Tips / Notes
- Specify target audience: "for business stakeholders," "for junior developers," "for executives"
- Add context request: "explain the business value" or "focus on security implications"
- For complex code: "break down into smaller sections and explain each"

## Variants
- "Explain to a developer" (more technical, focus on design patterns and trade-offs)
- "Security review explanation" (focus on security implications and vulnerabilities)
- "Performance explanation" (focus on efficiency, complexity, bottlenecks)
- "Code review format" (explain what it does + suggest improvements)
