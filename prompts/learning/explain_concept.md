## Tips / Notes
- Specify audience level: "explain like I'm 5," "explain like I'm 12," "explain for high school level"
- Add learning goal: "so I can explain it to others" or "so I can apply it in my work"
- Request analogies: "use a cooking analogy" or "relate to everyday technology"
- For technical topics: "build from first principles" or "use visual descriptions"

## Variants
- "ELI5 format" (extremely simple, playful tone)
- "Explain with visual metaphor" (describe an image or diagram)
- "Socratic explanation" (use questions to guide understanding)
- "Build-up explanation" (start simple, progressively add complexity)
