- Specify question format: "all multiple choice," "short answer only," "mix of types"
- Add constraints: "no negative questions," "include 'all of the above' options"
- Request Bloom's taxonomy levels: "focus on analysis and synthesis"
- For practice: "include hints for each question"

## Variants
- "Exam simulation" (timed, comprehensive, realistic difficulty)
