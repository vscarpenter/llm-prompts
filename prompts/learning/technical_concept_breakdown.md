> 2. **The Problem It Solves** - Why this exists, what problem necessitated it
> 3. **How It Works** - The mechanism/approach (with analogy if helpful)
> 4. **Key Components/Concepts** - Important pieces to understand
> 5. **Common Use Cases** - When you'd use this in practice
> 6. **Tradeoffs & Limitations** - What it's not good for, constraints to know
> 7. **Related Concepts** - How it connects to other ideas
