> **Facilitation Tips:**
> - Everyone contributes (use silent writing first if needed)
> - Focus on systems/processes, not individuals
> - Action items should be concrete and measurable
> - Review previous retro action items first
>
> Keep it blame-free and solution-focused. The goal is continuous improvement, not finger-pointing.

## Tips / Notes
- Do retros regularly (every sprint or after major milestones)
- Rotate facilitators to get different perspectives
- Follow up on action items in next retro
- Try different formats (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, Sailboat) to keep it fresh

## Variants
**Incident Retrospective** - Focus on timeline, root cause, prevention measures

**Project Post-Mortem** - Deeper analysis for major projects with metrics review

**Team Health Check** - Focus on team dynamics, communication, collaboration
