## Tips / Notes
- Focus on progress: "focus on the progress user is trying to make"
- Include competing solutions: "what do users fire when they hire us?"
- Request job map: "break job into stages (beginning, middle, end)"
- For innovation: "identify underserved jobs or unmet needs"

## Variants
- "Job mapping" (detailed breakdown of job stages and needs at each stage)
- "Forces of progress" (push/pull forces driving users toward new solution)
- "Competing solutions analysis" (what users currently hire to get job done)
- "Outcome-driven innovation" (desired outcomes users want from job)
