# Daily Plan Structurer

## Prompt
> Create an optimized daily schedule based on my tasks and priorities.
>
> Tasks for today: "{{task_list}}"
> Working hours: "{{start_time}} to {{end_time}}"
> Energy patterns: "{{morning_person|afternoon_person|evening_person}}"
> Constraints: "{{meetings_or_commitments}}"
>
> **Daily plan format:**
>
> **Morning Block** ({{time_range}})
> - [High-priority deep work task]
> - [Time estimate]
>
> **Midday Block** ({{time_range}})
> - [Meetings/collaboration]
> - [Administrative tasks]
>
> **Afternoon Block** ({{time_range}})
> - [Focused work or creative tasks]
> - [Time estimate]
>
> **End of day** ({{time_range}})
> - [Wrap-up, planning, light tasks]
>
> **Buffer time**: Include 15-min breaks and 10% slack time

## Tips / Notes
- Specify work style: "time blocking," "pomodoro technique," "flexible flow"
- Add energy optimization: "schedule deep work during peak energy hours"
- Include breaks: "25-min work, 5-min break" or "90-min work, 15-min break"
- For remote work: "include exercise/walk blocks" or "separate work from personal time"

## Variants
- "Weekly plan" (structure entire week with themes per day)
- "Time audit" (analyze where time actually goes vs. planned)
- "Maker schedule" (long uninterrupted blocks for deep work)
- "Manager schedule" (1-hour blocks for meetings and context switching)
