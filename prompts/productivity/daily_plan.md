## Tips / Notes
- Specify work style: "time blocking," "pomodoro technique," "flexible flow"
- Add energy optimization: "schedule deep work during peak energy hours"
- Include automations: "propose calendar holds, reminder nudges, habit stacking triggers"
- Ensure breaks: "25-min work, 5-min break" or "90-min work, 15-min break"
- For remote work: "include exercise/walk blocks" or "separate work from personal time"
- Request pre/post-work routines: "morning warm-up, end-of-day shutdown"

## Variants
- "Weekly plan" (structure entire week with themes per day)
- "Time audit" (analyze where time actually goes vs. planned)
- "Maker schedule" (long uninterrupted blocks for deep work)
- "Manager schedule" (1-hour blocks for meetings and context switching)
