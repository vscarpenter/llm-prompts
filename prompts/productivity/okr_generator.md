## Tips / Notes
- Specify scope: "company-level," "team-level," "individual contributor"
- Add context: "we're a startup in growth mode" or "enterprise with mature product"
- Request alignment: "align with company OKRs: [list parent OKRs]"
- For cascading: "create team OKRs that support this organizational objective"

## Variants
- "Individual OKRs" (personal professional development goals)
- "OKR tree" (company → team → individual alignment)
- "OKR health check" (evaluate existing OKRs for quality)
- "Mid-cycle OKR adjustment" (revise based on progress and learnings)
