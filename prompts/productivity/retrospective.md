## Tips / Notes
- Share async prep questions beforehand so teammates arrive with inputs
- Specify format: "Start-Stop-Continue," "Mad-Sad-Glad," "4Ls (Liked-Learned-Lacked-Longed for)"
- Add focus: "focus on process improvements" or "focus on team dynamics"
- Include psychological safety check-in (e.g., quick pulse on confidence to speak up)
- For remote teams: "async-friendly format with voting"
- Request facilitation tips: "include ice-breaker questions" or "techniques to get quieter members to contribute"

## Variants
- "Project post-mortem" (after major project completion or failure)
- "Quick daily standup retro" (5-minute reflection format)
- "Quarterly team health check" (broader team effectiveness review)
- "Incident retrospective" (blameless analysis of outages or bugs)
