# Task Breakdown (Work Breakdown Structure)

## Prompt
> Break down this large project into manageable, actionable tasks.
>
> Project: "{{project_description}}"
> Deadline: "{{deadline}}"
> Team size: "{{team_size}}"
> Constraints: "{{constraints}}"
>
> **Breakdown structure:**
>
> **Phase 1: [Phase Name]** (Duration: X days/weeks)
> - Task 1.1: [Specific action] (Owner: [role], Time: X hours/days)
> - Task 1.2: [Specific action] (Owner: [role], Time: X hours/days)
> - Deliverable: [What's produced]
>
> **Phase 2: [Phase Name]** (Duration: X days/weeks)
> - Task 2.1: [Specific action]
> - ...
>
> **Dependencies:** Note which tasks must complete before others can start
> **Critical path:** Highlight sequence that determines project duration
> **Risks:** Identify potential blockers for each phase

## Tips / Notes
- Specify granularity: "break down to 4-hour tasks" or "weekly milestones only"
- Add methodology: "use agile sprints," "waterfall phases," "hybrid approach"
- Request estimation: "include time and effort estimates"
- For team projects: "assign roles" or "identify skill requirements"

## Variants
- "Sprint planning" (2-week agile sprint structure)
- "Milestone-based breakdown" (major deliverables only)
- "Critical path analysis" (focus on dependencies and bottlenecks)
- "Resource allocation plan" (who does what when)
