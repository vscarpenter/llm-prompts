# Rewriting for Tone / Clarity / Style

## Prompt
> You are a professional editor. Rewrite the following text to improve clarity, tone, grammar, and flow, while preserving the original meaning.  
> Text: "{{input_text}}"

## Tips / Notes
- Adjust tone (formal, casual, friendly) by appending a clause.
- Use "preserve meaning" to avoid hallucination.

- Specify target audience: "for executives," "for technical readers," "for general public"

## Variants
- "Rewrite but simpler (grade-level 8)"
- "Rewrite for CMO / high-level exec, more persuasive"
- "Produce 3 versions, then your pick with rationale"
- "Make it more concise (cut 30% while preserving meaning)"
- "Rewrite for specific format: email, blog post, social media"
